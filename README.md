# What is it?

Game made in HTML5 Canvas / JS, cookie clicker-like game, taking the phrase "every cloud has a silver lining" literally

The object is to harvest as many clouds (like cookies) as possible and upgrade your harvesting farm!

It's a project that we did just for fun in 12 hours.

# Upgrades

HpS = increases cloud harvest limit per second

Volume = increases the amount of clouds you can have at a time

VpS = increases how many clouds come in per second

Max SpV = increases the amount of silver you harvest per cloud
